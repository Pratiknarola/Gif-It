## What am I looking at?
**Gif-It** - An online tool to Make Gifs from portion of any Any* Youtube Video

*Any\*: Video Playback should be enabled for other sites*
## Why it exists?
For [ContriHUB-21](http://contrihub21.herokuapp.com/)

## How it works?
Currently FFMPEG is being used as a binary(same as on LINUX) and executing the commands on the Shell with the help of the node-server. Part of the process was to get the source url of the Youtube Video which is done using youtube-dl-exec library. So, As a result
Process of converting and fetching the gif from the server is slower, sometimes Request may Time Out as Heroku has limit of 30 seconds of until Timed Out Responses.

**NOTE**: Future prospects are to make this completely Client Side. See [Live Demo](https://gif-it-now.herokuapp.com) for basic functionality.


## How to run it locally?
1. > ***Clone this repo to your local machine and cd into the Gif-It directory.***
2.     npm i
   > This will download all the required dependencies for the application to run on your local machine.
3. > ***Create the .env file at root of the Project and add all the environment Variables with appropriate values to it as illustrated in .env.sample***
4. > As you might notice from .env.sample file you need an API KEY for using Youtube-Data-Api. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N18czV5tj5o) is quick guide for generating one. Add this key to .env file.
5.     npm start
   > This will start react development serve at port 3000(by default)
6.     npm run serve
   > This will start node-server at port 5000(by default)
   
## How to use it?

> Search with keywords about the video just like youtube.com
